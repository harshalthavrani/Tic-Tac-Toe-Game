# Tic-Tac-Toe-Game

Created a turn based 2-player Tic-Tac-Toe game using C# with an attractive and colourful user interface design. 

Showed appropriate messages (e.g., X wins/O wins) at the end. Also showed Tie message if there was no winner at the end and was able to restart the game automatically.
